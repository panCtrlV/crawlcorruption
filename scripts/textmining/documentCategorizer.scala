/**
 * Document Categorizer is an interesting tool provided by Apache OpenNLP,
 * which allows you to classify text into pre-defined categories of your
 * choice. That being said, this tool does not come with a pre-trained model
 * as the categories are subjective (categorized to users' liking). Hence it
 * is required by the user who intend to use the Document Categorizer to
 * train their own model using the Document Categorizer tool or the API
 * (programmatically).
